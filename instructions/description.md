interactive, camera-based game inspired by fruit slicing mechanics. The agent will utilize real-time video input to track the player's body and arm movements using AI image recognition techniques (e.g., MediaPipe and TensorFlow.js). In the game, fruits are launched from the bottom of the screen, and the player "slices" them by moving their arms across the screen. Successful slices trigger visual and audio feedback. The MVP emphasizes simple fruit animation, accurate hand tracking, and collision detection between the player's arm motion and the fruit. This ai should be good at detecting arms of people in the camera.
